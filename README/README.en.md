# C Studies - College

This repository contains code I'm developing during my college studies, focusing on learning fundamental concepts of the C programming language. The topics covered so far include:

- 🔹 Pointers  
- 🔹 Structs  
- 🔹 Functions

## Objective

To document and practice the main C programming concepts studied in college courses, with simple and well-commented examples to aid in review and understanding.

## 📂 File Organization

- `pointers/`: Introductory code examples on pointers in C, covering basic concepts such as declaration, assignment, and simple usage.
- `structs/`: Examples and exercises using `struct` to group related data into a single structure.
- `functions/`: Practice with C functions, including definition, calling, and parameter passing.
